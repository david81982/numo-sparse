# Numo::Sparse

Welcome to your new gem!
Numo-sparse is a sparse tensor library that will allow the user to create sparse matrices to improve data structure and funcionality in ruby.

In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/numo/sparse`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.
